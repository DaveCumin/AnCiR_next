### Analysis of Circadian Rhythms (AnCiR) v4.0.0

This is our 'AnCiR' to the need for a simple-to-use (GUI; no coding) tool for analysis of circadian rhythms.

This version is written in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) by [DaveCumin](https://github.com/davecumin) and [yz-329](https://github.com/yz-329). The [previous](https://github.com/DaveCumin/ancir_svelte) version was also written in Svelte, and the [version before that](https://github.com/DaveCumin/AnCiR) was written in Javascript without Svelte.

**Please feel free to send any bug reports, feature requests, or offers of support to [d.cumin@auckland.ac.nz](mailto:d.cumin@auckland.ac.nz?subject=AnCiR)**
