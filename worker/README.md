# ancir-nl — natural language → AnCiR session (Cloudflare Worker)

Turns a prompt into an AnCiR session and returns a link that opens it. **No engine, no VM**:
the model emits one JSON draft, the pure normalizer (`src/emit/`) turns it into a session, and
the AnCiR SPA computes the analyses in the user's browser when it loads. That's what makes this
a ~70 KB Worker instead of a 1 GB box.

See the ADR: `2026-07-15-static-session-emission` (in the vault).

## Routes

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /build` | `{prompt, llm:{baseUrl,apiKey,model}, options?}` → `{url, sessionUrl, sessionId, warnings, errors}` |
| `POST /mcp` | remote **MCP server** (JSON-RPC) — an agent builds sessions with no clone, no key |
| `GET /sessions/:id` | the session JSON (CORS `*`, so AnCiR can fetch it cross-origin) |
| `GET /health` | `{ok:true}` |

`url` is the payoff: `https://<ancir>/?loadFromURL=<sessionUrl>` — open it and the session
builds itself in the browser.

## `/mcp` — the remote MCP server

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http ancir https://ancir-nl.david-cumin.workers.dev/mcp
```

That's the whole setup: no clone, no `npm install`, no VM. Two tools:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `list_capabilities` | every analysis and plot, with exact flat args, the columns each produces, and the fitted-curve pairing — straight from `session-schema.generated.json` |
| `build_session` | a draft → normalizer → KV → the `?loadFromURL=` link, plus `structuredContent.{url,sessionUrl,sessionId,errors,warnings}` |

**No LLM call and no API key** — the calling agent *is* the model, so `/mcp` never touches
`OPENAI_*` and never spends the default key's quota. It's the same normalizer `/build` uses,
minus the inference step.

**It cannot return computed results.** The browser computes when the link is opened, so the
agent gets a session to look at, not numbers to reason over. An agent that needs live values
still wants the engine MCP (`mcp/src/server.js`, `npm start`) — that's the whole point of
keeping both.

Hand-written JSON-RPC rather than `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`: the SDK's Streamable HTTP
transport is built on Node's `req`/`res` and won't run on Workers. A tools-only server needs
only `initialize` + `tools/list` + `tools/call`, so the SDK would be cost without benefit. The
server is stateless — `GET /mcp` returns 405 (the spec's own way of saying "no SSE stream"),
and there's no session id to track. `worker/mcp.test.js` drives it through the Worker's `fetch`,
and it's verified against `wrangler dev` with the real SDK client.

Rate limiting applies to `build_session` only, not the handshake — a client spends two requests
on `initialize`/`tools/list` before doing anything, and those shouldn't eat the budget.

## Bring-your-own model

The caller sends `llm.{baseUrl,apiKey,model}` per request; the key is used for one upstream call
and is never stored or logged. **The deployer pays nothing.** The Worker exists to (a) proxy the
LLM — providers don't send CORS headers, so a browser can't call them directly — and (b) enforce
the SSRF/validation guards (`app/validation.js`).

To offer a fallback model instead, set `OPENAI_BASE_URL`/`OPENAI_MODEL` as vars and
`OPENAI_API_KEY` as a **secret** (`npx wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY`).

## Deploy

```bash
# 1. transient session store (once) — paste the id into wrangler.toml
npx wrangler kv namespace create SESSIONS

# 2. point at your AnCiR deployment (wrangler.toml [vars])
#    ANCIR_BASE_URL = "https://ancir.pages.dev"

# 3. ship it
npm run worker:deploy
```

Free tier is ample: sessions are transient (TTL `SESSION_TTL_S`, default 24 h), and the bundle
is ~70 KB gzipped.

## Local

```bash
npm run worker:dev     # wrangler dev, local KV, SSRF guard relaxed (ALLOW_LOCAL_LLM=1)
npm run worker:test    # node:test — fake KV + stubbed LLM, no network
```

`worker:dev` relaxes the SSRF guard so you can point `llm.baseUrl` at a local Ollama
(`http://localhost:11434/v1`). A **deployed** Worker can't reach a user's localhost anyway.

## Rate limiting

**Already on** — `wrangler.toml` declares Cloudflare's own rate limiter, so it's enforced at
the edge, per client IP:

```toml
[[ratelimits]]
name = "RATE_LIMITER"
namespace_id = "1001"                        # just an id YOU pick for this limiter
simple = { limit = 10, period = 60 }         # period accepts ONLY 10 or 60 (seconds)
```

`wrangler deploy` prints `env.RATE_LIMITER (10 requests/60s)` to confirm. Change `limit`, and
redeploy — there's no dashboard step. **This matters now that the default model runs on your
key**: without it, `/build` is an open, funded proxy.

> **Why not WAF "rate limiting rules"?** Those are the dashboard feature people usually mean,
> but they're **zone-level and need a custom domain** — they don't apply to a `workers.dev`
> URL. The binding above works on `workers.dev`.

The KV counter (`BUILD_RATE_MAX`) remains only as a fallback for when the binding is absent
(tests, stripped config); it's best-effort, since KV is eventually consistent.

**What the user sees:** a blocked request returns 429 + `Retry-After`, and AnCiR's AI dialog
shows *"Too many requests. The AI service limits how often sessions can be built — wait about
60s and try again."* rather than a raw status code.

## Reading the prompt logs

Every `/build` writes one structured line, so you can review what people actually ask for:

```json
{ "event":"build", "ts":"2026-07-17T00:12:49.650Z",
  "prompt":"Simulate 4 days of a 24 h rhythm, fit a cosinor, and plot it",
  "model":"openai/gpt-oss-120b", "baseUrl":"https://api.groq.com/openai/v1",
  "llmKeySource":"worker-default", "outcome":"ok", "ms":23,
  "sessionId":"75e8…", "nodes":["SimulatedData","Cosinor"], "plots":["scatterplot"],
  "errors":[], "warnings":[] }
```

`outcome` is one of `ok`, `llm_error`, `llm_unreachable`, `unparseable_draft`, `empty_session`
— **failures are logged too**, which are the interesting ones (they show where the prompt or the
model let the user down). `errors`/`warnings` can be non-empty even on `ok` (a node dropped, or
dynamic outputs not pre-allocated).

**Two ways to read them:**

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Live tail** (debugging now) | `npx wrangler tail --config worker/wrangler.toml --format pretty` |
| **Stored + queryable** (reviewing later) | Cloudflare dashboard → **Workers & Pages** → *ancir-nl* → **Observability** |

The dashboard view is on because `wrangler.toml` sets `[observability] enabled = true`; without
it, logs only stream to `tail` and vanish.

**Where to actually look.** The Events list shows one row per *invocation*, and its Message
column is the HTTP line (`POST …/build`) — the prompt is **not** in that column. Expand the
`/build` row to see the log the Worker emitted. Because it's logged as an **object** (not a
JSON string), Workers Logs indexes its fields, so you can query them directly, e.g.
`outcome != "ok"` or search `prompt`. Logging a stringified object would land as one opaque
message that only text-search can reach — hence `console.log({...})`, not
`console.log(JSON.stringify({...}))`.

**Nothing appears?** Almost always one of: (a) the Worker hasn't been redeployed since the
logging was added — `npm run worker:deploy`; or (b) you're looking at events from before that
deploy. Confirm quickly with `wrangler tail` and one `curl` to `/build`.

**Retention is ~7 days on the free plan** — if you want to keep them longer, or run real
analysis over them, write to KV/D1/R2 or an external sink instead. Say the word and I'll add
that.

**What is and isn't recorded** — deliberately:
- **Yes:** the prompt (the point), which model answered, outcome, timing, what got built.
- **No:** any API key — neither a caller's nor the Worker's secret. `llmKeySource` says *whose*
  key was used (`caller` / `worker-default`) without revealing it. There are tests asserting this.
- **No IP address.** Adding one would make these logs personal data; add it only if you need it.
- Prompts are user-typed content, so the modal tells users they're logged.

## Gotchas

- **`compatibility_date` must not be newer than your wrangler's workerd binary**, or
  `wrangler dev` refuses to start. `deploy --dry-run` won't catch it (it never boots the
  runtime) — bundling ≠ running.
- `nodejs_compat` is required: the normalizer bundles `@stdlib`'s seeded PRNG (SimulatedData).
- Regenerate the node catalogue after any AnCiR registry change:
  `npx vite-node src/emit/gen-schema.js` — the prompt and the normalizer both read it.
- Rate limiting here is a best-effort KV counter (`BUILD_RATE_MAX`/min/IP). Cloudflare's native
  rate limiting is the real defence.
